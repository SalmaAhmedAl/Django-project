# My First Django Project

This is my first Django project, which consists of multiple applications. Each application serves a different purpose. Let's dive into the details of each application.

## Applications

### Hello

The Hello application is a simple greeting app. It allows you to say hello to anyone or anything. You can input a name or an object, and the application will display a greeting message accordingly.

### New Year Checker

The New Year Checker application is a simple HTML page renderer. It tells you whether it is currently the new year or not. It displays a message indicating whether it is a new year or not based on the current date.
